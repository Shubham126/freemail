### Data Transparency (Why we request permission)
- **Headline**: Why we request permission to access your email
- **Subheadline**:
    - To provide our core features—unsubscribing and bulk deleting—FreeMyMail requires restricted access to your inbox. We believe in complete transparency about how this access is used.
    - **Crucial**: When you sign in with Google, FreeMyMail uses the Gmail API to access your inbox metadata (sender, subject, date) strictly for identifying newsletters and performing unsubscribe or delete actions initiated by you.
- **Points**:
    - **Read-Only Metadata**: We scan email headers (sender, subject, date) locally on your device to identify newsletters and organize your inbox. We do not read the body content of your personal emails.
    - **Deletion Authority**: We request "modification" permissions solely to execute the delete or trash commands *you* initiate. We never delete anything without your explicit action.
    - **Local Processing**: FreeMyMail complies with Google's Limited Use Policy. Your data is processed directly in your browser and is not transferred to external servers for storage or analysis.
    - **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share your data with advertisers or third parties. Our business model is based on premium features, not data monetization.
